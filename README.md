## Use Instructions
This project makes use of Gulp v4.0 which is still under development. It has really nice features built in that make build pipelines quick and efficient.

To see a list of all available tasks, type `gulp ---tasks`.

The ones that you should be calling are probably:
* `gulp` - which builds a version of the site designed to work locally
* `gulp build` - builds without serving up the site
* `gulp clean` - cleans out the files that Gulp builds
