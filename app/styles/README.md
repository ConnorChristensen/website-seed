# Styles

This is the folder where all styling related elements go.

Generally set for SCSS and CSS, any code dropped in here will be compiled down into css and injected into the html documents.

## Folder Structure

Recommendations for folder structure are as follows:

* modules: components that will be reused amongst pages (eg. buttons, panels)
* variables: code that contains styling variables (good for holding things like color schemes)
* vendors: code that gets downloaded from other sources
